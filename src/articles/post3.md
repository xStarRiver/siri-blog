:::tip President and Vice-presidents' self introduction
Vice-President: 5D Cheng Tsz Ying

HELLO EVERYBODY!!üôåüèª I am the Vice-President of Siri, 5D Cheng Tsz Ying Kelly. Therefore, I believe I'm suitable for this post because I am a passionate and extroverted person with good communication skills. As the Vice-President of External Affairs, I am mostly responsible for contacting other schools, helping the President to organize different activities with other schools. Besides, I will find more discounts and services, and also organize a wide range of innovative activities for all of you. I bet y' all will love it!!

I've been a monitress, a member of the class committee and the Green House. I like to help others and organize different activities, and I really enjoy the process of cooperating with one anotherü•∞. I am going to make the best use of my experience gained in the past, and bring you all a wonderful and fruitful school life.

Coming to F5, I've found out that time passes rapidly. In the blink of an eye, my secondary school life has nearly come to an end. However, it seems that I did not treasure all these precious times. Also, because of the COVID-19, we spent more of the time having online lessons instead of having time at school. Since face-to-face school events are limited, we have fewer opportunities to interact with our schoolmates. It‚Äôs indeed a challenge for everyone to have a memorable and fruitful school life as before under the current circumstances. Therefore, I hope I can make some contribution to our school this year. I hope everyone can get a chance in finding their own happiness through different activities we organize in school.

Taking part in the Student Union is definitely not a walk in the park. There are lots of obstacles during our preparation. But our cabinet's members will spare no effort and work towards the same goalüî•. We will also carry on our school's Student Union tradition, and add in our cabinet's innovation as our strength. We will also listen to our students' needs and advice, just like "Siri", and speak for our students. Although there is only a year for us, we will keep our promise and try our utmost to build a better future for everyone, and also let our students get relaxed in a high-pressure learning environment.

I hope that everyone can vote for Siri‚ú®Give us the opportunity to exhibit our talents and passion to serve all of you!

President: 5D Ngan Wai

Let me ask you all, which of the following is  your favorite? Our IG posts, promotion products, the website, or the promotion videos? For me, it is the promotion videos. Every promotion video was planned and edited by me. My criteria are to finish every video and everything with the highest quality. This belief also apply to our cabinet‚Äôs every action and thought in order to pursue perfection, which is the same as our slogan, Reach Infinity.

Some of the students may have seen me before, as I‚Äôve participated in different clubs and become a committee member of them. I was the President of SeeTV last year, and I tried my best to bring the best show for you. From these experiences, what  benefited me the most was management. Because of the instability amid  COVID-19, there were always some ad hoc announcements for the whole school. I needed to ensure that all types of equipment were fully ready for the live broadcast  every day, including the arrangement of manpower in a short period of time. After a year, I‚Äôve accustomed to this work mode and teamwork. I‚Äôm going to apply this work mode to our cabinet. Over  the past one and a half months, we‚Äôve finished every job efficiently with high quality‚Äî finding welfare and supporting schools, planning all kinds of services and activities, and promoting.

At the same time, I‚Äôm one of the members of last year‚Äôs Student Union Mercury. Mercury is committed to organizing events for our students as much as they can. Inspired by this, I‚Äôve suggested organizing a range of activities that won‚Äôt be affected by the COVID-19. Apart from this, I‚Äôve been the Class President, the committee member of the Blue House, and a few club presidents. It gave me lots of chances to learn and cooperate with others. Do you guys like the profile photos of our members? All these photos were taken by me and I‚Äôm really satisfied with them, especially with the photos taken in the school. As we can neither go back to school at weekends nor stay after school because of the pandemic, our cabinet‚Äôs members need to go back to school at 7 am or even earlier, hoping to show our best quality to all of you as well as showing our determination and courage despite  COVID-19.

I am a passionate person who loves technology. I always pay attention to digital information. But the thing that I am obsessed with even more is investigating computer and shooting equipment. After reviewing my own academic results, I decided to step up  and run  for the President of the Student Union. Wanting to apply my ability and what I‚Äôve learned in CFS to give it all back to you and those who have taught me, finally, I‚Äôve started Siri. You may think that I‚Äôm a quiet student. However, I love doing sports and I‚Äôm good at it . After all, filming is an activity that requires  lots of energy (you may take a look at our promotion video‚Äôs behind the scenes). 

Many of you may not know that I own a Taekwondo Black Belt. I remember that my coach reminded me every lesson, ‚ÄúPractising Taekwondo is not for fighting with others but practicing for your own attitude, your sense of propriety, patience, and also strength in heart and mind‚Äù. When I face difficulties thinking about our publicity platform, it always reminds me to persist. When I was worried about the promotion products, it reminded me to stay calm and keep going. Combining my experience in Student Union, SeeTV, class committee, the Blue House, Rummikub club, Taekwondo, different technology competitions as well as the  courses in CUHK, I believe that I have the ability to take up this post, serving you all with my full heart.

Last but not least, I hope my cabinet can become a unique Student Union. To pursue this, we‚Äôve made our armbands, a website, an online forum, high-quality promotion videos, and a series of innovative activities and services. Besides this, there are lots of things and details waiting for all of you to discover. Just like our promotion video, we will make use of technology and innovativeness to dispel the heavy haze of the COVID-19.

Please support and vote for Siri.
